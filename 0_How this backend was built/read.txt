1) In my local computer I installed python and postgresql.
2) My computer uses windows OS, so I have to install https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
   for the ssl certificates i want to implement in my postgres instance.
3) Created a directory to store openssl files and open key.
4) Enabled SSL in my postgresql instance/service
5) I created a Python virtual environment and install FastAPI dependencies 
   and activated of course, added it to gitignore
