On my local computer, I installed Python and PostgreSQL.
My computer uses Windows OS, so I had to install OpenSSL from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html for the SSL certificates I want to implement in my PostgreSQL instance.
I created a directory to store OpenSSL files and generated the SSL keys.
I enabled SSL in my PostgreSQL instance/service.
I created a Python virtual environment, installed FastAPI dependencies, and activated it in cmd. Of course, I also added it to .gitignore.
I created a user and password for postgresql, values have to change in prodction deployment: CREATE USER fastapi WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
I Created a DB: CREATE DATABASE proveo;
I started using Alembic: pip install alembic, alembic init alembic;
I modified alembic.ini so it is uselful and added the models.py files to connect alembic to the database
I made sure config.py , .env, models.py and alembic env.py had the correct configuration/ values
I created the first migration file without running the upgrade command, evaluated the creation of schema as first step and modify everything accordingly
To create a version is with this: alembic revision -m "create fastapi schema and tables"
To go to the head, use this: alembic upgrade head
